/**
 * A multiplexor of {@link SelectableChannel} objects.
 *
 * <p> A selector may be created by invoking the {@link #open open} method of
 * this class, which will use the system's default {@link
 * java.nio.channels.spi.SelectorProvider selector provider} to
 * create a new selector.  A selector may also be created by invoking the
 * {@link java.nio.channels.spi.SelectorProvider#openSelector openSelector}
 * method of a custom selector provider.  A selector remains open until it is
 * closed via its {@link #close close} method.
 *
 * <a name="ks"></a>
 *
 * <p> A selectable channel's registration with a selector is represented by a
 * {@link SelectionKey} object.  A selector maintains three sets of selection
 * keys:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 *   <li><p> The <i>key set</i> contains the keys representing the current
 *   channel registrations of this selector.  This set is returned by the
 *   {@link #keys() keys} method. </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> The <i>selected-key set</i> is the set of keys such that each
 *   key's channel was detected to be ready for at least one of the operations
 *   identified in the key's interest set during a prior selection operation.
 *   This set is returned by the {@link #selectedKeys() selectedKeys} method.
 *   The selected-key set is always a subset of the key set. </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> The <i>cancelled-key</i> set is the set of keys that have been
 *   cancelled but whose channels have not yet been deregistered.  This set is
 *   not directly accessible.  The cancelled-key set is always a subset of the
 *   key set. </p></li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> All three sets are empty in a newly-created selector.
 *
 * <p> A key is added to a selector's key set as a side effect of registering a
 * channel via the channel's {@link SelectableChannel#register(Selector,int)
 * register} method.  Cancelled keys are removed from the key set during
 * selection operations.  The key set itself is not directly modifiable.
 *
 * <p> A key is added to its selector's cancelled-key set when it is cancelled,
 * whether by closing its channel or by invoking its {@link SelectionKey#cancel
 * cancel} method.  Cancelling a key will cause its channel to be deregistered
 * during the next selection operation, at which time the key will removed from
 * all of the selector's key sets.
 *
 * <a name="sks"></a><p> Keys are added to the selected-key set by selection
 * operations.  A key may be removed directly from the selected-key set by
 * invoking the set's {@link java.util.Set#remove(java.lang.Object) remove}
 * method or by invoking the {@link java.util.Iterator#remove() remove} method
 * of an {@link java.util.Iterator iterator} obtained from the
 * set.  Keys are never removed from the selected-key set in any other way;
 * they are not, in particular, removed as a side effect of selection
 * operations.  Keys may not be added directly to the selected-key set. </p>
 *
 *
 * <a name="selop"></a>
 * <h2>Selection</h2>
 *
 * <p> During each selection operation, keys may be added to and removed from a
 * selector's selected-key set and may be removed from its key and
 * cancelled-key sets.  Selection is performed by the {@link #select()}, {@link
 * #select(long)}, and {@link #selectNow()} methods, and involves three steps:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ol>
 *
 *   <li><p> Each key in the cancelled-key set is removed from each key set of
 *   which it is a member, and its channel is deregistered.  This step leaves
 *   the cancelled-key set empty. </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> The underlying operating system is queried for an update as to the
 *   readiness of each remaining channel to perform any of the operations
 *   identified by its key's interest set as of the moment that the selection
 *   operation began.  For a channel that is ready for at least one such
 *   operation, one of the following two actions is performed: </p>
 *
 *   <ol>
 *
 *     <li><p> If the channel's key is not already in the selected-key set then
 *     it is added to that set and its ready-operation set is modified to
 *     identify exactly those operations for which the channel is now reported
 *     to be ready.  Any readiness information previously recorded in the ready
 *     set is discarded.  </p></li>
 *
 *     <li><p> Otherwise the channel's key is already in the selected-key set,
 *     so its ready-operation set is modified to identify any new operations
 *     for which the channel is reported to be ready.  Any readiness
 *     information previously recorded in the ready set is preserved; in other
 *     words, the ready set returned by the underlying system is
 *     bitwise-disjoined into the key's current ready set. </p></li>
 *
 *   </ol>
 *
 *   If all of the keys in the key set at the start of this step have empty
 *   interest sets then neither the selected-key set nor any of the keys'
 *   ready-operation sets will be updated.
 *
 *   <li><p> If any keys were added to the cancelled-key set while step (2) was
 *   in progress then they are processed as in step (1). </p></li>
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p> Whether or not a selection operation blocks to wait for one or more
 * channels to become ready, and if so for how long, is the only essential
 * difference between the three selection methods. </p>
 *
 *
 * <h2>Concurrency</h2>
 *
 * <p> Selectors are themselves safe for use by multiple concurrent threads;
 * their key sets, however, are not.
 *
 * <p> The selection operations synchronize on the selector itself, on the key
 * set, and on the selected-key set, in that order.  They also synchronize on
 * the cancelled-key set during steps (1) and (3) above.
 *
 * <p> Changes made to the interest sets of a selector's keys while a
 * selection operation is in progress have no effect upon that operation; they
 * will be seen by the next selection operation.
 *
 * <p> Keys may be cancelled and channels may be closed at any time.  Hence the
 * presence of a key in one or more of a selector's key sets does not imply
 * that the key is valid or that its channel is open.  Application code should
 * be careful to synchronize and check these conditions as necessary if there
 * is any possibility that another thread will cancel a key or close a channel.
 *
 * <p> A thread blocked in one of the {@link #select()} or {@link
 * #select(long)} methods may be interrupted by some other thread in one of
 * three ways:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 *   <li><p> By invoking the selector's {@link #wakeup wakeup} method,
 *   </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> By invoking the selector's {@link #close close} method, or
 *   </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> By invoking the blocked thread's {@link
 *   java.lang.Thread#interrupt() interrupt} method, in which case its
 *   interrupt status will be set and the selector's {@link #wakeup wakeup}
 *   method will be invoked. </p></li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> The {@link #close close} method synchronizes on the selector and all
 * three key sets in the same order as in a selection operation.
 *
 * <a name="ksc"></a>
 *
 * <p> A selector's key and selected-key sets are not, in general, safe for use
 * by multiple concurrent threads.  If such a thread might modify one of these
 * sets directly then access should be controlled by synchronizing on the set
 * itself.  The iterators returned by these sets' {@link
 * java.util.Set#iterator() iterator} methods are <i>fail-fast:</i> If the set
 * is modified after the iterator is created, in any way except by invoking the
 * iterator's own {@link java.util.Iterator#remove() remove} method, then a
 * {@link java.util.ConcurrentModificationException} will be thrown. </p>

/**
 * SelectableChannel对象的多路复用器。
 *
 * 可以通过调用此类的open方法来创建selector，该方法将使用系统的默认SelectorProvider来创建新的selector。
 * selector也可以通过调用自定义SelectorProvider的openSelector方法来创建。
 * selector保持打开状态，直到通过其close方法关闭它为止。
 *
 * 可选通道向selector的注册由SelectionKey对象表示。selector维护三组selection keys：
 * - key set包含代表此selector当前所有通道注册的key。该集合由keys方法返回。
 * - selected-key set，使得在先前的选择操作期间，每个key的channel被检测为准备好在key的insterest set中标识的至少一个操作。
 *      该集合由selectedKeys方法返回。所选键集始终是键集的子集。
 * - cancelled-key set是已取消但其channel尚未注销的key set。此set不能直接访问。cancelled-key set始终是key set的子集。
 *
 * 在新创建的selector中，所有三个set均为空。
 *
 * 一个key被添加到selector的key set中，作为通过channel的register方法注册channel的副作用。
 * 在select操作期间，已取消的key将从key set中删除。key set本身不能直接修改。
 *
 * 取消key时，无论是通过关闭其channel还是通过调用其cancel方法，都会将一个key添加到其selector的cancelled-key set中。
 * 取消key将导致其channel在下一次select操作期间被注销，这时该key将从所有selector的key set中删除。
 *
 * 通过select操作将key添加到selected-key set。
 * 通过调用集合的remove方法或调用从集合中获得的迭代器的remove方法，可以直接从selected-key set中删除key。
 * 决不能以任何其他方式将key从selected-key set中删除。
 * 作为select操作的副作用，尤其不要删除它们。key可能无法直接添加到selected-key set中。
 *
 * Selection
 * 在每个select操作期间，可以将keys添加到selector的selected-key中或从中删除，也可以将其从selected-key和cancelled-key中删除。
 * 选择是通过select()，select(long)和selectNow()方法执行的，包括三个步骤：
 *   1、cancelled-key set中的每个key都从其所属的每个key set中删除，并且其通道已注销。此步骤将cancelled-key set设置为空。
 *   2、询问底层操作系统是否有更新，有关每个剩余通道的准备情况，以执行自select操作开始时由其key的interest set标识的任何操作。
 *      对于准备进行至少一项此类操作的通道，将执行以下两个操作之一：
 *      1.1 如果通道的key尚未在selected-key set中，则将其添加到selected-key set中，并修改其ready-operation set，以准确标识现在通知通道已准备就绪的那些操作。
 *          先前记录在ready set中的任何准备信息都将被丢弃。
 *      1.2 否则，通道的key已经在selected-key set中，因此修改其ready-operation set以识别报告通道已准备就绪的任何新操作。
 *          保留先前记录在ready set中的所有准备信息；换句话说，底层系统返回的ready set按位分离到key的当前ready set中。
 *      如果在此步骤开始时key set中的所有key都具有空interest sets，则selected-key set和任何key的ready-operation sets都不会更新。
 *   3、如果在执行步骤（2）时将任何key添加到cancelled-key set中，则将按步骤（1）进行处理。
 * select操作是否阻塞等待一个或多个通道准备就绪，如果等待了多长时间，则是三种选择方法之间的唯一本质区别。
 *
 * Concurrency
 * selector本身可以安全地供多个并发线程使用。但是，它们的key sets不是。
 * select操作按该顺序在selector本身，key set和selected-key set上同步。它们还与上面的步骤（1）和（3）期间的cancelled-key set设置同步。
 * 
 * 在进行select操作时，对selector的key的interest sets所做的更改对该操作没有影响；他们将在下一个select操作中被看到。
 * 
 * 可以随时取消key并关闭通道。因此，在一个或多个selector的key set中存在key并不表示该key有效或其通道已打开。
 * 如果其他线程有可能取消key或关闭通道，则应用程序代码应谨慎同步并在必要时检查这些条件。
 *
 * 在select()或select(long)方法之一中阻塞的线程可能会以三种方式之一被其他线程中断：
 * - 通过调用selector的wakeup方法，
 * - 通过调用selector的close方法，或者
 * - 通过调用阻塞线程的interrupt方法，在这种情况下，将设置其interrupt status并调用selector的wakeup方法。
 *
 * close方法以与selector操作相同的顺序在selector和所有三个key set上同步。
 *
 * 通常，selector的key set和selected-key sets不能安全地用于多个并发线程。
 * 如果此类线程可以直接修改这些set之一，则应通过在set本身上进行同步来控制访问。
 * 这些set的迭代器方法返回的迭代器是fail-fast的：
 *      如果在创建迭代器之后修改set，则除了通过调用迭代器自己的remove方法之外，
 *      通过其他任何方式都将抛出java.util.ConcurrentModificationException。
